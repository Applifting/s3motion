s3motion
======================
s3motion is a combination of both a command line utility and REST based microservice used to upload and download local objects and transfer objects between S3 compatible storage.

## Description
s3motion creates a simple CLI user interface or REST based microservice for migrating, copying, uploading, and downloading of objects to S3 compatible storage. The uses cases can be: 
- a command line tool to upload/download objects
- a move/copy individual objects at scheduled intervals between buckets
- migrate between services. copy entire bucket, then change your application to point to new service

## Installation
Make sure node.js and npm is installed first, then install it globally by issuing: `npm install s3motion -g`

To run it as a microservice by utilizing the REST implementation, deploy it in a docker container that can be called from any application. `docker run emccode/s3motion`

## CLI Usage
All commands are accessible via the `-h` or `--help` flag. Only one flag can be used during a single command. There are two modes to run the CLI utility. You can choose to pass all arguments through a single command, or run the wizard. To run the wizard simply type `wiz` or `wizard` after your chosen flag (ie `s3motion -n wizard`).

- `-n` or `--newClient`: Add a new client to a locally stored s3motionClients.json object. The clients are used as a way to store credential information locally and pipe those in for operational use. The s3motionClients.json will be stores in the current users working home directory. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--name`: This is an arbitrary name you are using to identify your client. This name must be unique and cannot be the same as one previously used. If you want to use a previously configured name, edit the s3motionClients.json object. This is a required argument.
	- `--accessKeyId`: This is the S3 Access Key/ID. This is a required argument.
	- `--secretAccessKey`: This is the S3 Secret Access Key. This is a required argument.
	- `--endpoint`: Only specify this if you are trying to access third-party S3 compatible storage. If you are adding a new client for AWS, leave this blank. The endpoint assumes `https` and port `443`, therefore, a DNS or IP address will work such as `vipr.emc.com`. If your storage uses unsecured access, then you must specify the protocol and port such as `http://vipr.emc.com:80`. If you're endpoint uses a different port that can be specified as `vipr.emc.com:10101` which assumes `https`.
- `-L` or `--listClients`: List all the clients available in the s3motionClients.json object. No arguments needed for this command.
- `-b` or `--listBuckets`: List all the avialable buckets for a specific client. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
- `-N` or `--newBucket`: Create a new bucket for a client. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
	- `--name`: Specify the name of the new bucket. This is a required argument.
- `-l` or `--listObjects`: List all the objects in a bucket. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
	- `--bucket`: Specify the name of the bucket. This is a required argument.
- `-d` or `--downloadObject`: Download an object(s) from a bucket. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
	- `--bucket`: Specify the name of the bucket. This is a required argument.
	- `--object`: Specify the name of the object. If the object is nested within a folder, specify the directory listing as well: `images/myimages/avatar.png`. You can also specify multiple objects to download by using a comma and no spaces such as `object1.png,object2.png,images/myimages/avatar.png`. This is a required argument.
	- `--folder`: Specify the location on your local machine where the object(s) will be download to. `/Users/me/Desktop`. If no folder is specified, then the object is downloaded to the current working directory. This is an optional argument.
- `-u` or `--uploadObject`: Upload an object(s) to a bucket. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
	- `--bucket`: Specify the name of the bucket. This is a required argument.
	- `--object`: Specify the name of the object. By default, uploaded objects will be placed in the root directory. This is a required argument.
	- `--folder`: Specify the location on your local machine where the object(s) will be uploaded from. `/Users/me/Desktop`. If no folder is specified, then the object is downloaded to the current working directory. This is an optional argument.
- `-D` or `--deleteObject`: Delete an object(s) from a bucket. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--client`: Specify the name of the locally configued client. This is a required argument.
	- `--bucket`: Specify the name of the bucket. This is a required argument.
	- `--object`: Specify the name of the object. If the object is nested within a folder, specify the directory listing as well: `images/myimages/avatar.png`. You can also specify multiple objects to delete by using a comma and no spaces such as `object1.png,object2.png,images/myimages/avatar.png`. This is a required argument.
- `-c` or `--copyObject`: Copy an object(s) from one client to another. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:
	- `--sourceClient`: Specify the name of the locally configued client where the object is stored. This is a required argument.

	- `--destBucket`: Specify the name of the bucket where the object will be copied to. This is a required argument.
	- `--delete`: Default is `n` which means the source copy will remain in the bucket. Specify `Y` if the source object should be deleted upon a successful transfer.
- `-C` or `--copyBucket`: Bulk copy process for all object from one bucket to another. Here are the following arguments that can be passed for a single line command:

- `s3motion -R` or `s3motion --REST`: Start a webservice listening on port 8080 for REST based commands.

## REST Usage
In addition to running this as a command line, it can also accept REST requests. To begin the microservice to accept REST commands use `s3motion -R`. You will see a message that says **s3motion microservice started on port 8080**. All requests must go through /api, for example `http://myserver.mycompany.com:8080/api`. All requests are returned with JSON. The default port used is always `:8080`.

The following REST commands are available to you.

- /api/clients
  - GET: Returns a JSON object with all clients configured in the s3motionClients.json object

- /api/bucket/copy
  - POST: Copies one bucket to an another in its entirety. Payload requires `sourceClient`, `sourceBucket`, `destClient`, and `destBucket`. You will never get a "success" status message as a response because depending on the amount of objects that must be copied over could take a while and the browser will timeout.

- /api/objects/:client/:bucket
  - GET: Returns a JSON object with all objects in a bucket. Depending on the amount of objects, the browser may timeout. The timeout is currently set to 4 minutes for Express.js, but most browsers will timeout after 2 minutes. You will need a browser with a configurable timeout to wait for the objects to be collected. Anything greater than >100,000 objects will more than likely timeout after 2 minutes.

## Future
- Add these functions depending on necessity
  - delete bucket including all objects (scary)
  - sync buckets between endpoints
  - upload object to a specific folder inside a bucket (just needs another param)
  - error messages for incorrect bucket spelling
  - bucket copy process don't specify destination Bucket, just copy the name of the source bucket.
  - bucket copy process needs to copy empty folders or create those entries on the destination bucket.
- Continue Microservice using Express.js
- Clean up the code
  - break out into multiple objects
- Web front end
- Create logging functionality
